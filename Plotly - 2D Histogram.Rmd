Interactive 2D Histogram - Looks like a Heat Map to me!
```{r}
library(plotly)
s <- matrix(c(1, -.75, -.75, 1), ncol = 2)
obs <- mvtnorm::rmvnorm(500, sigma = s)
plot_ly(x = obs[,1], y = obs[,2], type = "histogram2d")
```
Let's try another heatmap concept that provides interactive features.
```{r}
#install.packages("d3heatmap")
library(d3heatmap)
url <-"http://datasets.flowingdata.com/ppg2008.csv"
nba_players <- read.csv(url, row.names = 1)
d3heatmap(nba_players, scale = "column")
```
