title: "Human Capital in the AI Age"

Data science, artificial intelligence, automation, and other advanced technologies are reshaping the world.
We're starting to see glimpses of it, for example the rapid emergence of self driving cars. Moreover, 
the changes brought about by technology will likely become more frequent and more dramatic in the next few years.
 
In fact, two MIT economist, Erik Brynjolfsson and Andrew McAfee, think that the emergence of AI and data 
driven technologies may be one of the most important events in all of human history. 
 
## Risk and opportunity in the age of AI
 
They suggest that AI and automation will dramatically increase productivity and human development. 
In essence, AI, machine learning, and data-driven technology will free us from our cognitive limitations 
much like the engine freed us from our physical limitations. This will in turn lead to large gains 
in productivity.
 
But while AI and data-driven tech will likely increase productivity, they are also likely to lead to 
high levels of unemployment. As software and technology become more intelligent, they will replace people 
who don't have the right skills.
 
## A critical factor for success: human capital
 
How can someone succeed in such an era?
 
Brynjolfsson and McAfee point out that one of the keys to success in the age of data, AI, and automation will be human capital.
 
As technology increasingly substitutes for people, one of the keys to success will be cutting-edge knowledge, 
judgement (particularly in complex domains)and creativity.
 
## Mapping Human Capital
# 
In thinking about this, I decided to map which countries have the highest levels of human capital, 
as measured by the World Economic Forum.
 
While the WEF's Human Capital Index is not a perfect index of cutting edge skill, it does provide a high-level 
view of the countries that may be better prepared for a changing, high-tech world.
 
One thing in particular that I'll note, is that this map effectively shows averages of national performance. 
Having said that, talent and innovation are known to be highly uneven geographically. There are "spikes." 
So even though this map shows countries' average performance, we'd likely see an even different story 
if we looked at cities (or even zip codes).
